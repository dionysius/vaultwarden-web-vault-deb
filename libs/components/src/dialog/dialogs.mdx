# Dialog

Dialogs are used throughout the app to help the user focus on a specific action.

Use the main [Dialog Component](?path=/docs/component-library-dialogs-dialog--docs). when content
exceeds 384px width or there are a high number of interactive elements needed. **Example:** The web
app's edit vault item form dialog

For alerts or simple confirmation actions, like speedbumps, use the
[Simple Dialog](?path=/docs/component-library-dialogs-simple-dialog--docs).

Dialogs's should be used sparingly as they do call extra attention to themselves and can be
interruptive if overused.

## Placement

Dialogs should be centered vertically and horizontally on screen. Dialogs height should expand to
fit its content until there are 2rems of margin on the top/bottom of the dialog; in this case, the
dialog should become scrollable.

A backdrop should be used to hide the content below the dialog. Use `#000000` with `30% opacity`.

## Accessibility

### Component behavior

- Dialog include `role="dialog"`
- The Dialog title is an `<h1>`
- A user should not be able to tab focus outside of the Dialog until it has been closed.
- Clicking outside the dialog or clicking escape should close the dialog (this prevents a keyboard
  trap)

### Required per implementation

The triggering button should indicate to assistive technology that additional content will open or
appear when the trigger is selected. Consider using `aria-haspopup="true"`

Dialog title should be announced by a screen reader when launched. Consider using `aria-labelledby`
or `aria-label`

When opened, focus should follow the visual order of the popover’s focusable content. Typically
focus is moved to the close button, but it is acceptable to move focus to the first interactive
element after close since a user may not want to close the dialog immediately if there are
additional interactive elements. See
[WCAG Focus Order success criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html)

Once closed, focus should remain on the element which triggered the Dialog.

**Note:** If a Simple Dialog is triggered from a main Dialog, be sure to make sure focus is moved to
the Simple Dialog.
