## Supported Trigger Components

This is the list of currently supported trigger components:

- Icon button `muted` variant

## Accessibility

The disclosure and trigger directive functionality follow the
[Disclosure (Show/Hide)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/) pattern for
accessibility, automatically handling the `aria-controls` and `aria-expanded` properties. A `button`
element must be used as the trigger for the disclosure. The `button` element must also have an
accessible label/title -- please follow the accessibility guidelines for whatever trigger component
you choose.
