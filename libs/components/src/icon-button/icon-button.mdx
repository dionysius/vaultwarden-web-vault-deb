## Usage

Icon buttons can be found in other components such as: the
[banner](?path=/docs/component-library-banner--docs)
[dialog](?path=/docs/component-library-dialogs--docs), and
[table](?path=/docs/component-library-table--docs).

## Styles

There are 4 common styles for button main, muted, contrast, and danger. The other styles follow the
button component styles.

### Main

Used for general icon buttons appearing on the theme’s main `background`

<Canvas of={stories.Main} />

### Muted

Used for low emphasis icon buttons appearing on the theme’s main `background`

<Canvas of={stories.Muted} />

### Contrast

Used on a theme’s colored or contrasting backgrounds such as in the navigation or on toasts and
banners.

<Canvas of={stories.Contrast} />

### Danger

Danger is used for “trash” actions throughout the experience, most commonly in the bottom right of
the dialog component.

<Canvas of={stories.Danger} />

### Primary

Used in place of the main button component if no text is used. This allows the button to display
square.

<Canvas of={stories.Primary} />

### Secondary

Used in place of the main button component if no text is used. This allows the button to display
square.

<Canvas of={stories.Secondary} />

### Light

Used on a background that is dark in both light theme and dark theme. Example: end user navigation
styles.

<Canvas of={stories.Light} />

**Note:** Main and contrast styles appear on backgrounds where using `primary-700` as a focus
indicator does not meet WCAG graphic contrast guidelines.

## Sizes

There are 2 sizes for the icon button: `small` and `default`.

Default is typically used for most instances. Small is used if the implementation needs a variant
with less padding around the icon, such as in the navigation component.

### Small

<Canvas of={stories.Small} />

### Default

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Accessibility

Follow guidelines outlined in the [Button docs](?path=/docs/component-library-button--doc)

Always use the `appA11yTitle` directive set to a string that describes the action of the
icon-button. This will auto assign the same string to the `title` and `aria-label` attributes.

`aria-label` allows assistive technology to announce the action the button takes to the users.

`title` attribute provides a user with the browser tool tip if they do not understand what the icon
is indicating.
