# Badge

Badges are primarily used as labels, counters, and small buttons.

Typically Badges are only used with text set to `text-xs`. If additional sizes are needed, the
component configurations may be reviewed and adjusted.

The Badge directive can be used on a `<span>` (non clickable events), or an `<a>` or `<button>` tag
for interactive events. The Focus and Hover states only apply to badges used for interactive events.
The `disabled` state only applies to buttons.

The story below uses the `<button>` element to demonstrate all the possible states.
