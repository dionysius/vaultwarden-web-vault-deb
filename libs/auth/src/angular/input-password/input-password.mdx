# InputPassword Component

The `InputPasswordComponent` allows a user to enter master password related credentials. On
submission it creates a master key, master key hash, and emits those values to the parent (along
with the other values found in `PasswordInputResult`).

The component is intended for re-use in different scenarios throughout the application. Therefore it
is mostly presentational and simply emits values rather than acting on them itself. It is the job of
the parent component to act on those values as needed.

<br />

## `@Input()`'s

**Required**

- `inputPasswordFlow` - the parent component must provide the correct flow, which is used to
  determine which form input elements will be displayed in the UI.
- `email` - the parent component must provide an email so that the `InputPasswordComponent` can
  create a master key.

**Optional**

- `loading` - a boolean used to indicate that the parent component is performing some
  long-running/async operation and that the form should be disabled until the operation is complete.
  The primary button will also show a spinner if `loading` true.
- `masterPasswordPolicyOptions` - used to display and enforce master password policy requirements.
- `inlineButtons` - takes a boolean that determines if the button(s) should be displayed inline (as
  opposed to full-width)
- `primaryButtonText` - takes a `Translation` object that can be used as button text
- `secondaryButtonText` - takes a `Translation` object that can be used as button text

## `@Output()`'s

- `onPasswordFormSubmit` - on form submit, emits a `PasswordInputResult` object
- `onSecondaryButtonClick` - on click, emits a notice that the secondary button has been clicked.
  The parent component can listen for this event and take some custom action as needed (go back,
  cancel, logout, etc.)

<br />

## Form Input Fields

The `InputPasswordComponent` can handle up to 6 different form input fields, depending on the
`InputPasswordFlow` provided by the parent component.

**InputPasswordFlow.SetInitialPassword**

- Input: New password
- Input: Confirm new password
- Input: Hint
- Checkbox: Check for breaches

**InputPasswordFlow.ChangePassword**

Includes everything above, plus:

- Input: Current password (as the first element in the UI)

**InputPasswordFlow.ChangePasswordWithOptionalUserKeyRotation**

Includes everything above, plus:

- Checkbox: Rotate account encryption key (as the last element in the UI)

<br />

## Validation

Validation ensures that:

- The current password and new password are NOT the same
- The new password and confirmed new password are the same
- The new password and password hint are NOT the same

<br />

## On Submit

When the form is submitted, the `InputPasswordComponent` does the following in order:

1. If the user selected the checkbox to check for password breaches, they will recieve a popup
   dialog if their entered password is found in a breach. The popup will give them the option to
   continue with the password or to back out and choose a different password.
2. If there is a master password policy being enforced by an org, it will check to make sure the
   entered master password meets the policy requirements.
3. The component will use the password, email, and default kdfConfig to create a master key and
   master key hash.
4. The component will emit the following values (defined in the `PasswordInputResult` interface) to
   be used by the parent component as needed:

```typescript
export interface PasswordInputResult {
  newPassword: string;
  hint: string;
  kdfConfig: PBKDF2KdfConfig;
  masterKey: MasterKey;
  serverMasterKeyHash: string;
  localMasterKeyHash: string;
  currentPassword?: string; // included if the flow is ChangePassword or ChangePasswordWithOptionalUserKeyRotation
  rotateUserKey?: boolean; // included if the flow is ChangePasswordWithOptionalUserKeyRotation
}
```
